        <h3> Projects</h3>
        <h4> AMPLIFY (Horizon Europe)</h4>
        <center><emph>November 2024 - present</emph></center>

        <p>AMPLIFY is a consortium of artists, technologists, and researchers from 8 European countries dedicated to facilitating the digital transition in the Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs). AMPLIFY will develop, test, and pilot two innovative suites of digital technologies empowered by AI and XR for CCIs, based on a human-centric approach that balances the tools and their use, so that the whole project delivers not only innovative technologies, new ways of working, and enhanced audience experiences, but also sustainable economic models consistent with the beliefs, values, and practices of the creators and audiences for wider societal benefit.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h4> OPEN-DASH-PC (SPIRIT Open Call)</h4>
        <center><emph>September 2024 - present</emph></center>

        <p>OPEN-DASH-PC tackles the limitations of current real-time, multi-user immersive communication protocols, which face scalability issues and require complex central server algorithms. We propose Ultra Low Latency Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP for Point Cloud content (ULL-DASH-PC). This open-source transport protocol enables efficient, multi-quality, multi-user communication through point cloud data. By advancing the state of immersive communication, OPEN-DASH-PC will support both academic and industrial innovation.</p></br>
        <p></p>
        <h4>INDUX-R (Horizon Europe)</h4>
        <center><emph>January 2024 - present</emph></center>

 
<p>INDUX-R envisions a human-centric XR ecosystem that will transform European industrial sectors by empowering humans and creating innovative XR products and services of significant added value. It targets concrete scientific breakthroughs integrated into technological enablers that will be applied in use cases driven by real-life needs while having the potential to be replicated in several other applications. These breakthroughs are focused on core XR technologies, namely, digitization and creation of XR assets, realistic animation, light-field HMDs, XR media streaming, and egocentric perception. To address the challenges that multi-user XR applications pose, INDUX-R will implement a highly scalable, zero-touch 5G architecture and a secure, interoperable IoT network that can accommodate fluctuating demands and minimize waste of resources.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>TransMIXR (Horizon Europe)</h4>
<center><emph>October 2022 - present</emph></center>

<p>The mission of TransMIXR is to introduce leading-edge technologies and experiences built around public values: to inform & entertain, to connect & inspire, to educate and empower. Its ambition is to strengthen the democratic mission and competitiveness of the European Cultural and Creative Sector with intelligent AI and XR technologies that are user-centric, transparent, trustworthy, inclusive, and accountable.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>VOXReality (Horizon Europe)</h4>
<center><emph>October 2022 - present</emph></center>

<p>VOXReality is an ambitious project whose goal will be to facilitate and exploit the convergence of two important technologies, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Vision systems drive both AR and VR, while language understanding adds a natural way for humans to interact with the backends of XR systems, or create multi-modal XR experiences combining vision and sound. </p>
<p></p>

<h4>NWO WISE</h4>
<center><emph>September 2021 - present</emph></center>

<p>The project focuses on on designing and integrating novel algorithms to improve compression and transmission efficiency of immersive media contents through Quality of Experience (QoE) optimization. </p>

<span id="dots2"></span><div id="more2"></br>
    <h4>Past roles</h4>
<p><strong>European Network on Quality of Experience in Multimedia Systems and Services (Qualinet)</strong></br><emph>May 2017 - May 2024</emph></p>

<p>Leader of Task Force 7: Immersive Media Experiences (IMEx)</p>

<p><strong>VRTogether (EU Horizon 2020)</strong>
</br><emph>August 2019 - December 2020</emph></p>

<p>My role in the project is to develop Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics and evaluation methods to qualitatively assess social VR experiences.</p>

<p><strong>LIVE: Light field Image and Video coding and Evaluation (Swiss National Foundation for Scientific Research)</strong>
</br><emph>March 2016 - March 2019</emph></p>

<p>My focus on this project was on immersive methodologies for subjective quality assessment of light field contents, particularly under coding artifacts, and on novel compression solutions for transmission and storage of light field images.</p></div>
